# cdeeply-unix-bash
UNIX Bash shell interface to C Deeply's neural network generators.  *Note*:  these return neural networks embedded in a web page, not as raw data (since they aren't called from within an application).

Bash shell scripts to call the supervised (cdeeply_regression) and unsupervised (cdeeply_encoding) methods.
